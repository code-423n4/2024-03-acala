thanks

Hello, 

I would like some explanations in order to understand the ```payout_reward_and_reaccumulate_reward``` function (code-423n4/2024-03-acala/blob/main/src/modules/incentives/src/lib.rs)

How could there be "remaining rewards" after ```do_claim_rewards``` is executed?


[03/26/2024 15:28] ermal3014
the pool can be configured with `deduction_rate` meaning if you want to claim before loyalty program ends then part of the rewards goes back to pool

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[03/26/2024 16:00] souilos
Also if I am not wrong I can claim only a partial amount of my rewards right?


[03/26/2024 16:10] ermal3014
No, you claim everything on a pool


[03/26/2024 16:11] ermal3014
`deduction_rate` is more like a penalty fee from your rewards


[03/26/2024 16:13] ermal3014
it goes back to pool and becomes reward for users who remain loyal to ending period


[03/26/2024 16:28] souilos
Ok thanks 😊

[03/27/2024 13:46] souilos
Sorry but maybe we could open a private thread?

[03/28/2024 23:35] theschnilch
Is the deduction rate set to 0 in the ending period so that no one gets a penalty anymore?


[03/29/2024 06:00] ermal3014
Yes


[03/29/2024 07:47] ashopelessasmorty
hi @Ermal i am unable to use ```cargo build``` and ```cargo test``` is this because the linked repo is not the whole project? or is it an issue with my system?


[03/29/2024 08:47] carlos.w.
You should run `cargo build` in the dir which contains ` Cargo.toml`. -- `2024-03-acala/src`


[03/29/2024 11:44] ermal3014
Only these modules are in scope for audit


[03/29/2024 12:11] ashopelessasmorty
yes but should i be able to run cargo build on this repo?


[03/29/2024 12:11] ashopelessasmorty
i'm there only


[03/29/2024 12:12] ermal3014
Yes. You can build and run tests


[03/29/2024 12:44] carrotsmuggler
what error do you see in the terminal?


[03/29/2024 13:33] ashopelessasmorty
a series of 3200 errors that say "not found in this scope" for simple std types like Err and others. previously the cargo version was not working with the project as the toolchain mentions 1.74.0 so i used  ```rustup component remove cargo --toolchain 1.74.0
rustup component add cargo --toolchain 1.74.0```
now cargo itself is not throwing any errors but test and build are.


[03/29/2024 14:59] ashopelessasmorty
resolved by uninstalling and using toolchain 1.74.0 globally, thanks.


[03/29/2024 18:23] souilos
Where are the fees calculated when unstaking?


[03/30/2024 03:02] bryanchen
there is no fee with `unbond` but a fee for `unbond_instant` https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-acala/blob/28c60b339bc011d59fa05fda8276c8e70a7f5779/src/modules/earning/src/lib.rs#L188-L190

[03/30/2024 14:31] souilos
ok thanks! and other question, what's the MAX_ACA? is there gonna be a fixed supply or more tokens could be available with time?


[03/30/2024 14:35] theschnilch
What does this function do? As far as I can see, it is not used anywhere in the code and cannot be accessed from outside. https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-acala/blob/9c71c05cf2d9f0a2603984c50f76fc8a315d4d65/src/orml/rewards/src/lib.rs#L326-L361

Are all shares in a pool always equal to the total bonded amount in the earning module?

[04/02/2024 21:07] souilos
Where in the codebase is managed the Loyalty Bonus? When and where is it send to users?

I mainly looked at `do_claim_rewards`
